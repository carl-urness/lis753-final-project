        <h2>Religious Holidays</h2>
          <p>There are many faiths.  Three examples of religious winter holidays are found in Judaism, Kwanzaa and Christianity</p>
        <h3>Judaism</h3>

          <p>The Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, which falls in late November to late December (varying from year to year), commemorates the rededication of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem more than 2,000 years ago. Hanukkah is celebrated over a period of eight nights and days, and observed by kindling the lights on a nine-branched candelabrum called a menorah.</p>
          <p>Hanukkah festivities include playing dreidel (a game of chance using a four-sided spinning top inscribed with Hebrew letters), eating foods such as doughnuts and latkes, and — as with Christmas — exchanging gifts.</p>
        <h3>Kwanzaa</h3>
        <div>

          <p>Each year since 1966, millions of African Americans have connected with their African cultural and historical roots by celebrating Kwanzaa from December 26 to January 1. Honoring family, community and culture are at the heart of Kwanzaa, which families observe by decorating their homes with African-inspired art, African kente cloth and fruits that symbolize African idealism. Ceremonies may include drumming, musical performances and a candle-lighting ritual, culminating in a feast known as karamu. Today, many African-American families celebrate Kwanzaa along with Christmas.</P>
        <h3>Christianity</h3>

          <p>For Christians, Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is preceded by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night; in some traditions, Christmastide includes an octave. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians,and forms an integral part of the holiday season centered around it.</p>
